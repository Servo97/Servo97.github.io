Hello, welcome to my half quirky - half stereotypical academic website! I'm a first-year PhD in Robotics co-advised by Prof. Oliver Kroemer and Prof. Zeynep Temel. Prior to that, I was an MS in Robotics student at CMU and developed an array of 64 soft delta robots in an 8x8 grid to push the limits of dexterous manipulation with non-anthropomorphic soft robots. 

As a PhD student now, I'm trying to develop a framework that can assimilate techiques from Policy Gradients, Causal Discovery, and Cooperative Game Theory for sample efficient robot learning on soft robots for dexterous manipulation (phew that was a mouthfulðŸ˜—ðŸ’¨). 

Fundamentally, I want to help democratize robotics. My hardware is an attempt to do 2 things:
1. Demonstrate how soft robots enable a wide range of manipulation tasks while drastically reducing costs of manufacturing and maintenance. 
2. Create problems hard enough that throwing large models at them is impractical. This drives a need for sample-efficient robot learning algorithms that are structured and interpretable. 

Prior to joining CMU I used to work in HyperWorks Imaging, a small startup in Bangalore, where I worked on making conditional GANs and vision-based inference pipelines to save millions of dollars for Sila Nanotechnologies developing high energy density batteries. Before that, I did my Bachelors in Engineering at a small college in Mumbai University called VES Institute of Technology on a TFWS scholarship.

Please feel free to connect with me if you're interested in either causal discovery, multi-agent RL, or soft robots for manipulation!
