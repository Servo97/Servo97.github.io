Hello, welcome to my half quirky - half stereotypical academic website! Here are 2 truths and 1 lie (in no particular order) about me:
1. I love researching the use of soft robots for manipulation and human-robot interaction
2. I absolutely detest snow
3. I love cooking food and road trips to places of natural beauty

Before joining CMU I used to work in HyperWorks Imaging, a small startup in Bangalore, where I worked on making conditional GANs useful to material scientists and people from ad agencies.

Currently I'm interested in assistive healthcare robotics and applying causal learning to soft robots for manipulation.
