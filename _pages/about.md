Hello, welcome to my half quirky - half stereotypical academic website! Here are 2 truths and 1 lie (in no particular order) about me:
1. I love researching the use of soft robots for manipulation 
2. I absolutely hate Pittsburgh
3. I love cooking food and road trips to places of natural beauty

Prior to joining CMU, I used to work in HyperWorks Imaging, a small startup in Bangalore.
