                    <h3>Multi-Modal Super Resolution for Dense Microscopic Particle Size Estimation</h3>
                    <h4>Submitted to TPAMI, under review. Arxiv link: <a>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09594</a></h4>
                    <h5>Particle Size Analysis (PSA) is an important process carried out in a number of 
                        industries, which can significantly influence the properties of the final product. 
                        A ubiquitous instrument for this purpose is the Optical Microscope (OM). However, OMs 
                        are often prone to drawbacks like low resolution, small focal depth, and edge features 
                        being masked due to diffraction. We propose a powerful application of a combination of 
                        two Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) that Super Resolve OM images 
                        to look like Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. We further demonstrate the use 
                        of a custom object detection module that can perform efficient PSA of the super-resolved
                         particles on both, densely and sparsely packed images. The PSA results obtained from 
                         the super-resolved images have been benchmarked against human annotators, and results 
                         obtained from the corresponding SEM images. The proposed models show a generalizable 
                         way of multi-modal image translation and super-resolution for accurate particle size 
                         estimation.</h5>

                    <h4>International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology (IJARIIT)<br><a>https://www.ijariit.com/manuscripts/v4i2/V4I2-2159.pdf</a></h4>
                    <h5>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been gaining a lot of impetus in the recent times. Drones are constantly being made
                        available for a myriad of day-to-day applications like food delivery, surveillance, farming, etc. One of the most overshadowed
                        regions in the list of applications remains to mine. Mining is a dangerous activity and more often than not, there are certain
                        unknown hazards to it that are too dangerous for humans to be experimenting with all by themselves. Hence it makes sense to
                        use a UAV in the form of a First-Person View (FPV) drone.<br><br>
                        For the development of a UAV, there are thousands of different permutations that can be used. After a detailed analysis of
                        various of them ranging from a simple tri-copter to an octocopter, a quadcopter design was unanimously selected as it provides
                        elegant support in the form of control, structure, reliability, cost, size, etc. Most important of them being size and structure.
                        Mines can be constricting places and a wide frame may become very difficult to control inside such enclosures.<br><br>
                        This project has been implemented on a much smaller scale than an actual prototype, primarily because of an ambitious
                        development schedule coupled with a very limited budget. These constraints have forced a compromise on the quality of the
                        components used but have not tampered with the real application objectives that the drone has to suffice. The drone at present
                        is being controlled by a remote-control transmitter, receiver couple but we are working on creating our own GUI which will
                        provide a direct control over all the systems from a remote laptop or android device.

                        This project required Object Detection and further classification of the beer cans of interest, while 
                        ignoring the others. Dataset had challenges like reflection of light from the ambient background
                        on the glass-doors, due to which, a StyleGAN2 model was trained on web-scraped images with data
                        manipulation. This made the GAN generate images that replicate the real world scenarios coarsely.
                        This made our classification model using ResNet101 architecture more robust.

                    <p>
                        This project was used in an R&D pipeline, which involved accurate sizing of microscopic particles.
                        Optical Microscope images were given as input. Super Resolved images that look like SEM were
                        generated by a combination of AASNA-Pix2Pix and an Improved ESRGAN using Spectral Normalization. 
                        Further, a custom object detection model was created for the super resolved images: Super
                        Resolution Particle Sizing Algorithm. The detection model gives output feature maps as 4D 
                        vectors, each pixel giving a map of <i>(p, x, y, r)</i> to detect the circle of a particle and its radius.
                        We wrote a paper on this project which is currently awaiting approval by the legal teams.

                    <h3>AutoML Tool for Automatic Feature Extraction and Model Training</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was an in-house product focused on generating intelligent models for classification 
                        and regression across a variety of datasets automatically. This project involved automatic
                        feature engineering, model training, and model ensembling to give the most generalizable
                        model for a particular dataset. The backend was created in Python using Django. Frontend 
                        was created using Angular 8 with graphs and plots using HighCharts. The web-app was
                        served using Nginx as a reverse proxy on a docker container.
