Developed a cross-platform app using React-Native. The app is an audio-only experimenting
with audio calling, recording of live as well as asynchronous conversations, and an audio
based map for proximity calls and live location sharing. The app extensively relies on high performance
socket connections for real-time updates as well as audio calls.

<h4>Tech Stack</h4> 
<ul>
    <li>Backend server: NodeJS</li>
    <li>Server Load Balancing + Reverse Proxy: Nginx</li>
    <li>Databases: Firebase + MongoDB + Redis</li>
    <li>App Development: React Native (Android + iOS)</li>
</ul>

The app was inspired by <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5394dfa6e4b0d7fc44700a04/t/5f5a8bd2bec7a45b9db0d41c/1599769555766/Kumar+Epley+%28in+press%29+Its+surprisingly+nice+to+hear+you+JEPG.pdf">this article</a> during the pandemic as a last attempt to develop a product as a startup. However, after 4 months of building an entire system from scratch, Clubhouse founders put together a bunch of expensive APIs and built their app in 14 days with massive VC backing and networks. We decided to shut down the project once they reached $1 Billion evaluation, and I went to grad school to pursue the labor of my love - Robotics!

<!-- The pandemic coupled with pay cuts, burnout, and loneliness devastated me, but simultaneously motivates me to conduct research on aspects of robotics that can not be easily replicated when I establish another startup in the future, potentially in the healthcare industry.  -->
