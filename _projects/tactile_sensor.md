Soft robots for manipulation can afford a wide range of actions purely on the back of compliance. However, for delicate everyday tasks, especially in the areas of robotic indoor assistance, human feeding, medicine delivery, and wound care, relying on compliance might not be enough. We need tactile feedback at a high frequency with high sensitivity to detect these contacts and act on them. 

Although there are established tactile sensors like <a href="https://www.gelsight.com/">GelSight</a>, and <a href="https://syntouchinc.com/">BioTac</a>, they either require a lot of compute, or are quite expensive, which defeats the low-cost objective of using soft robots for manipulation. 

Recent works like <a href="https://reskin.dev/">ReSkin</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15941.pdf">Biomimetic Tactile Sensor</a> have shown great potential of low-cost tactile sensing. Getting inspiration from these works, our project uses soft silicone elastomers to make an omni-directional tactile sensor with an array of magnets embedded around 4 magnetometers as shown below:

The main motivation for these sensors is for use with multi-finger soft hands that can't hold hefty sensors and need a wide range of sensing to accomplish dexterous manipulation tasks.
