I"¯<p>Hello, welcome to my half quirky - half stereotypical academic website! Here are 2 truths and 1 lie (in no particular order) about me:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I love researching the use of soft robots for manipulation and human-robot interaction</li>
  <li>I absolutely detest snow</li>
  <li>I love cooking food and road trips to places of natural beauty</li>
</ol>

<p>Before joining CMU I used to work in HyperWorks Imaging, a small startup in Bangalore, where I worked on making conditional GANs useful to material scientists and people from ad agencies.</p>

<p>Currently Iâ€™m interested in assistive healthcare robotics and applying causal learning to soft robots for manipulation.</p>
